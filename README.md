# Time-Spent-Compiling
Measure time spent compiling

Motivation
----------

I wanted to know time I lose everyday compiling, and find an objective way to measure improvements in compilation times. 

How to use it
-------------

To start measure time run this command:


`ct --start`

When task is finished run this command:


`ct --end`

To sum up time spend:

`ct --count`

###Where data is stored?

There is a file named ".compile_time" in your home dir (~). If you remove it will reset all stats
